    "# HW9 Problem 7 Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the weaknesses of rankings based solely on word counts, we explore the famous **pagerank** algorithm, which formed the basis for at least early versions of Google's search engine. Think of the whole internet as a directed graph where each node is a website, and there is a directed edge between node $i$ and $j$ if and only if website $i$ hyperlinks to website $j$. Intuitively, the pagerank algorithm seeks a ranking for which: \n",
    "- If a website is linked to by many other websites, then it's an important website\n",
    "- If a website has only a few links, but those links come from authoritative sites (such as www.brown.edu), then it's also important.\n",
    "- If a website links to a very large number of other websites, then the ``importance'' it transfers to each individual site is small. The pagerank algorithm uses Markov chains to allow the information provided by a link to implicitly flow both directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate pagerank, imagine a \"random surfer\" on the internet that starts at some webpage, and sequentially visits other webpages by following hyperlinks. As illustrated in Figure 1, the surfer chooses between the outgoing links from each page with equal probability. We can then define the \"importance\" of webpage $i$ as the long-term frequency with which this random surfer visits webpage $i$. If a node has $k$ outgoing edges, then the fraction of time a visit to this node is followed by each linked neighbor is only $\\frac{1}{k}$. Denoting the state transition matrix by $T$, if the initial location of the surfer is uniform over the $m$ nodes so $\\pi_{0} = [\\frac{1}{m},\\frac{1}{m},\\dots, \\frac{1}{m}]$, the probability of viewing each webpage after $n$ time steps is then $\\pi_{0}T^{n}$. If $n$ is large and there are paths between all pairs of nodes, the state probabilities will converge to a stationary distribution $\\pi = \\pi T$. Sorting these probabilities gives the pagerank.\n"
